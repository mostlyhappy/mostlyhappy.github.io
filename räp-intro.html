		I gathered people from the halls of my school and brought them to a classroom. <br>
		<br>
		There I asked them to breathe in unison and let out a sound while breathing out. <br>
		<br>
		As the recording goes on we move on from clean notes to weirder stuff. <br>
		<br>
		I explain this at the start of the video and apparently I didn't edit it out. The sounds start at 1:54. <br>
